# 🚢 Titanic Dataset — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

---

## 📌 Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Titanic dataset** to uncover survival patterns, demographic trends, and relationships between passenger attributes and survival chances.  
The analysis leverages Python libraries and Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning, visualization, and insights.

---

## ⚙️ Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the Titanic dataset  
- Handle missing values in `Age`, `Cabin`, and `Embarked`  
- Explore **survival rates** across gender, class, and age groups  
- Apply **feature engineering** (e.g., extracting titles, family size)  
- Visualize findings using charts and heatmaps  
- Summarize actionable insights  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python 3.x**  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `pandas` → Data manipulation  
  - `numpy` → Numerical analysis  
  - `matplotlib` → Data visualization  
  - `seaborn` → Statistical plots  
- **Jupyter Notebook** → Interactive analysis

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Gender & Class**:  
  - Women had significantly higher survival rates.  
  - First-class passengers had much better chances of survival compared to third-class.  

- **Fare Impact**:  
  - Higher ticket fares were strongly correlated with higher survival odds.  

- **Family Size**:  
  - Passengers traveling in small families (2–4 members) had better survival rates.  
  - Solo travelers and large families (>4) had lower survival.  

- **Title Patterns**:  
  - Extracted titles like “Mr.”, “Mrs.”, “Miss.” showed social status and survival differences.
